VB Directx 8 v1.0  01/2001

- Direct3D OCX 

This is a beta-beta-beta test.. so, don't worry if you run into bugs..
i developed it on a Celeron 466, NVidia Vanta LT 3D, Windows 2000
and sometimes i got errors.. but at least without critical system crash 

Let me fix all and for the moment try it if you like how it is going on 


this sample REQUIRES:

1) Directx8 Runtime or above installed
2) Win9x/Me/Win2000 (not NT)
3) 3D Video Card 
4) Visual Basic 6 runtime Installed

If you don't have Dx8 yet, try to download it at Microsoft site: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=27398


Features:
- Add Frames and meshes separatelly controlling them as single or grouped
- Mouse or keyboard Movement
- Tree object scene viewer (not so useful but i am working on)
- Walking mode
- Picking mode
- DXF loader
- X file loader
- Extruded mesh builder
- Land/Ground mesh generator (referred to Terrain.ocx, see the http url)
- Easy Textures
- Space world simulation
- Add Material/Textures opaque or transparent
- Easy load custom data file 


What i'd like improve:
- Manage object properties selecting them by tree or graphically 
- Patch bezièr surface generator
- Billinear surface generator
- BSPline/cubic surface generator
- Choose for controlling Light/Camera automatic or manual
- Fog


NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR:
THIS IS A FREE CONTROL AND I THINK I WILL KEEP IT LIKE THIS FOREVER. IT WILL GROW ONLY IF I WILL GET FEEDBACK FROM YOU.
